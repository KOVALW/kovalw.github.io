This project focuses on random variation, or stochasticity, which is either "environmental" or "demographic". Environmental stochasticity consists of random events that befall populations, such as weather fluctuations. Demographic stochasticity instead consists of the random events that befall individuals. When we build models of insect populations, it is common to ignore demographic stochasticity and favor averaging over individual fates. However, my research is showing that models incorporating demographic stochasticity are more informative than other models for estimating total infection rates. I'm bridging large-scale continental models of insect tree damage with epidemiological models of a few individuals, working to better forest health protection and advance our understanding of how a few individuals can alter the spread of epidemics in large populations.
