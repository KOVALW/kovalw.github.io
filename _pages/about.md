I'm currently a PhD candidate in the Ecology and evolution program at the University of Chicago, where I study the ecology of insect diseases. Insects are great systems for exploring epidemiological theory and I enjoy the ability to collect my own data. The moth I study is one of many  outbreaking insects that impact forest health, so, in addition to general ecological knowledge, I try to direct my research toward building and communicating effective tools for practioners predicting population dynamics. I'm interested in the intersection of computational modeling and land management, and firmly believe that each can learn from the other (though I'm certain that computational modeling has more to gain from that exchange). 

Originally from Atlanta, I first explored ecological research and modeling at Emory University, where I studied population dynamics of the West Nile vector *Culex quinquefasciatus* and the impact of human mobility on dengue case load distribution. (If you're going to visit Emory, I highly recommend Falafel King.)

  <h2>My research philosophy</h2>
  <p> In the computational components of my research, I tend to focus on capturing model uncertainty rather than parameter sensitivity. To let the data determine the bounds on uncertainty, I favor stochastic, mechanistic modeling and Bayesian statistical approaches. Like any researcher, my philosophy on the field of disease ecology and research in general is informed by what I read and the people I engage with. I believe that research is directly tied to the researcher and that we have to strive to unpack our own personal predispositions in order to improve our understanding and science. The following is a brief list of journal articles and books that have most shaped my views and inform my research process</p>
    <ul>
    <li>American Tropics: The Caribbean Roots of Biodiversity Science by Megan Raby, 2017</li>
    <li>Simha et al. Moving beyond the “Diversity Paradox”: the limitations of competition-based frameworks in understanding species diversity, The American Naturalist (2022). </li>
    <li>The carrier bag theory of fiction by Ursula K. LeGuin, 1986</li>
    <li>The dialectical biologist by Richard Levins and Richard Lewontin, 1985.</li>
