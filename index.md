I'm a disease ecologist studying the variation underlying disease dynamics of insect-baculovirus interactions. I'm broadly interested in spatial disease ecology. I'm particualrly interested in stochastic epidemic theory, mechanisms of dispersal, and the history of ecology, particularly as it relates to epidemiology and the development of theory.
