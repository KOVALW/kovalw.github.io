  <h2>My research</h2>
<p> I'm currently a PhD candidate in the Ecology and evolution program at the University of Chicago. Like my advisor Greg Dwyer, I'm interested in the diseases of insects as great systems for exploring ecological concepts. I also enjoy the aspects of collecting my own data that insect systems provide. I'm interested in the intersection of computational modeling and land management, and firmly believe that each can learn from the other (even while I'm certain computational modeling has more to gain from that dialogue). Because the moth I study, along with other periodically outbreaking insects, has a high impact on forest ecosystems, I try to use this mutual understanding to build and communicate effective tools for practioners predicting population dynamics. </p>
<p>Originally from Atlanta, I first explored ecological research at Emory University, where I studied population dynamics of the West Nile vector *Culex quinquefasciatus* and the impact of human mobility on dengue case load distribution. If you're going to visit Emory, I highly recommend Falafel King.</p>

  <h2>My philosophy</h2>
  <p> Like any researcher, my philosophy on the field of disease ecology and research in general is informed by what I read. The following is a list of journal articles and books that have shaped my views and inform my research process</p>
    <ul>
    <li>American Tropics: The Caribbean Roots of Biodiversity Science by Megan Raby, 2017</li>
    <li>The carrier bag theory of fiction by Ursula K. LeGuin, 1986</li>
    <li>The dialectical biologist by Richard Levins and Richard Lewontin, 1985.</li>
      <li>Simha et al. Moving beyond the “Diversity Paradox”: the limitations of competition-based frameworks in understanding species diversity, The American Naturalist (2022). </li>
  </ul>
