The efficacy of management strategies is hampered by our limited understanding of the variability in host-pathogen interactions. I am particularly interested in exploring how local variation across different spatial scales leads to distinct patterns of pathogen infection within insect host populations. To achieve this, I employ a range of observational, theoretical, and modeling approaches to gain a deeper understanding of the spatial dynamics of disease systems. In my previous research, I focused on mosquito systems and examined the transmission dynamics of West Nile virus and Dengue in *Culex* spp. and *Aedes* spp., respectively. Currently, my research is centered on environmentally-transmitted pathogens of forest insects, particularly Douglas-fir tussock moth (*Orgyia pseudotsugata*) and its associated baculovirus.
