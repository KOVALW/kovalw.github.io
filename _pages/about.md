I'm currently a PhD candidate in the Ecology and evolution program at the University of Chicago. Like my advisor Greg Dwyer, I'm interested in the diseases of insects as they're great systems for exploring ecological concepts and have a high impact on forest ecosystems. 

My previous research experinece dealt with population dynamics of the West Nile vector *Culex quinquefasciatus*.
