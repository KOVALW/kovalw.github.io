I'm a disease ecologist working to understand the variation of disease dynamics in insect-baculovirus interactions. I'm broadly interested in spatial disease ecology. I'm particualrly interested in stochastic epidemic theory, mechanisms of dispersal, the history of ecology, and entomology, particularly as these last two relate to the epidemiology and ecological modelling.
