My PhD thesis focuses on the mechanisms for virus coexistence in the Douglas fir tussock moth-baculovirus system. There are two virus morphotypes that are species specific to Douglas Fir tussock moth, which are characterized by different phenotypes and very low sequence homology. Across the Douglas fir tussock moth range, which is from the south western united states up to british columbia, the caterpillars experience varying host tree species and climates. There is also an interesting spatial pattern of the two morphotypes, where they coexistence appears to be high at intermediate latitudes and low at high and low latitudes. 

My research looks at how host tree species forest composition and differences in virus transmission may scale up to explain these large scale spatial patterns. I use transmission experiments done in the field to capture the realism of nature, in combination with mathematical models to answer these questions. I will expand these models to include how climate change may influence these patterns and the Douglas Fir tussock moth outbreaks in general. This work is done in collaboration with Carlos Polivka at the USDA Forestry Sciences Center in Wenatchee, WA.
