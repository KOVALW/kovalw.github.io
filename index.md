Welcome to my website. I'm a disease ecologist working to understand the variation of disease dynamics in insect-baculovirus interactions. I'm broadly interested in spatial structure, dispersal, the histroy of ecology, and entomology as they all relate to the study of disease tranmission. You can use this site to see a [description of my ongoing and previous research projects](/research) or learn more [information about me and how to get in touch](/about).
