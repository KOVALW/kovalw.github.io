Another year is in the books! This year, María D. Hernández Limón, Amanda Farah, and I taught our new and improved Introduction to Scientific Programming class. The course is taught in Python and we designed it to be a thorough introduction to the tools most graduate students in Biology and Physics would need. This is the class we all wish we were taught when we were first starting research. 

The materials for the course are available on the [NRT-DSEER github](https://github.com/NRT-DSEER/intro-programming-2022). We teach this course every fall, but each notebook is designed as a self contained lesson that could be gone through on the students own time.
